## Adapter for Blueriiot Blueconnect poolsensors

This adapter pulls information about your Blueconnect sensors from Blueriiot's unofficial API.
Please note that it's developed independently and is not affilated or endorsed by the vendor of the device.
An API change could lead to immediate malfunction of this adapter.

Please note that the adapter is a very early stage of development. Many things could change in the future.

### Getting started

Add the adapter to your ioBroker installation and supply your credentials.
Then set a schedule for the adapter to fetch data from Blueriiot's service.
